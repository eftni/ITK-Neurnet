# ITK-Neurnet
Amatuer machine learning project
This is a repository dedicated to my experiments with neural networks and machine learning. I am not a professional programmer, and none of the code posted here is going to be of great quality. Despite this, if you're interested in machine learning and would like to use my code for your own research, feel free to use it. Additionaly, if you find any bugs or errors, please notify me!
